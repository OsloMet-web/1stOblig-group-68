    <h1>Our old schools:</h1>

    <p>
        Stavanger Cathedral school has its roots dating back to 1200. 
        It stands next to the cathedral in the city center. 
        The school consists of the buildings Kongsgård and Bjerksted. 
        In Stavanger it has long been the school view with most prestige. 
        I really enjoyed my time there and think it is great.

    <h2>s371473</h2>
    <p>I went to Valler VGS. It was a good school, lots of dedicated and hardworking students. It was known
        for being a school for "nerds". The building itself is an old brickbuilding from 1888, which gives the school 
        a cool look.

        some renovation

    <h4>s376930</h4> 
    <p>I went to Lambertseter VGS. It is a fantastic school and one of the only schools in Oslo that has a sport subject side.
         Therefroe we had access to multiple sport arenas. It was a shame that Covid-19 took away 3 of the 6 terms.
